# Echo IPC library #

A simple and efficient interprocess communication (IPC) library for Linux written in C++11. The core part of the code was developed as a bachelor's thesis of Urban Škvorc with the title `Development of a library for interprocess communication in interactive systems` in 2015 at the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science. The library was later added some documentation and some polish and is now made available under MIT license.

 * Urban Škvorc (initial developer)
 * Luka Čehovin (developer, maintainer)

## Installation ##

The C++ library does not have any dependencies apart from a C++11 capable compiler, but if you want to compile Python bindings you have to download the [pybind11](https://github.com/wjakob/pybind11) template library.
