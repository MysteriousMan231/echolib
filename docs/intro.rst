Introduction to Echo
================================

Echo is a inter-process communication library for C++ and Python focused on performance and ease of use. It provides a publish/subscribe model for message passing and a simple data marshalling system with minimal overhead. If advanced data marshalling is required, various third party solutions (such as Flat Buffers) are supported.

Installation and use of the system are designed to be as simple as possible, and installation requires minimal dependencies. To get started with installing the system, click :doc:`here <installation>`. If you've already installed the system, read how to start using it :doc:`here (c++) <getting_started_cpp>` or :doc:`here (python) <getting_started_py>`.
